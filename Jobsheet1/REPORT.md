**Brief explanaton:** 
1. Input the nim
2. Modulo the nim, so that theres only 2 last digits left
3. If the nim < 10, add 10
4. Continue numbers 6 and 10
5. Loop the last 2 digits nim, if even print "*" 


## 2.3.1. Array Solution
The solution is implemented in Array.java, and below is screenshot of the result

**Brief explanaton:** 
1. Create array to store course name, credit weight, grade, letter grade, and grade point
2. Input the numerical grade for each course
3. Convert the numerical grade to grade point
4. Map the grade point to a letter grade
5. Calculate the total grade points and total credits
6. Calculate the GPA by dividing the total grades by total credits
7. Display course name, numerical grade, letter grade, and grade point
8. Print the GPA with 2 numbers after the comma


## 2.4.1. Function Solution
The solution is implemented in Function.java, and below is screenshot of the result
